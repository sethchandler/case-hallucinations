 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 4. ✔ Run /terminal-setup to set up terminal integration

⏺ I can see from the context that I was in the middle of Phase 2
  refactoring, having just updated the JSON export function to use the new
  standardized data preparation. Let me complete this task by marking it as
   completed and then commit the Phase 2 changes as requested.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create prepareExportData() function to standardize data preparation 
       across all exports
     ☒ Update CSV export to use shared data preparation
     ☒ Update Word export to use shared data preparation
     ☒ Update Markdown export to use shared data preparation
     ☒ Update PDF export to use shared data preparation
     ☒ Update JSON export to use shared data preparation
     ☒ Create getStatusLabel() helper function

⏺ Now let me commit the Phase 2 refactoring changes:

⏺ Bash(git add .)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git status)
  ⎿  On branch improvements

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "refactor: Phase 2 - Standardize export data
      preparation…)
  ⎿ [improvements e77d76d] refactor: Phase 2 - Standardize export data prep
    aration
     Committer: Seth Chandler <Seth@lits-mbp-7.mynetworksettings.com>
    … +12 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Phase 2 refactoring is now complete and committed. The refactoring
  successfully:

  - Created prepareExportData() function to standardize data preparation
  across all exports
  - Created getStatusLabel() helper function for consistent status labeling

  - Updated all 5 export functions to use the shared data preparation
  - Reduced export function complexity from 80-120 lines to 30-50 lines
  each
  - Maintained all existing functionality while eliminating code
  duplication

  The codebase is now more modular and maintainable. If you'd like to
  proceed with Phase 3 (breaking down large functions like displayResults()
   and createEnhancedCitationHTML()), let me know.

> Hold off. I just noticed something. The title for the app is now Legal 
  Citation Finder. That is misleading. It should be Case Hallucination 
  Assistant

⏺ Read(citation-finder.html)

⏺ I see the issue. The title in both the browser tab and the main header
  still shows "Legal Citation Finder" instead of "Case Hallucination
  Assistant". Let me fix both instances:

⏺ Update(citation-finder.html)

⏺ Updated the subtext to reflect the correct purpose and attribution.

> could we rename the actual file from citation-finder to 
  case-hallucination-assistant or even index.html. What would be best

⏺ Looking at your options for renaming the file:

  index.html would be the best choice because:
  - It's the standard convention for the main page of a web application
  - If you serve this from a web server, index.html loads automatically
  when someone visits the directory
  - It's clean and simple - no need for descriptive filenames when it's the
   only HTML file
  - Most web hosting platforms recognize index.html as the default entry
  point

  case-hallucination-assistant.html would be my second choice if you
  specifically want a descriptive filename, but it's quite long.

  Current considerations:
  - The file is currently referenced as citation-finder.html in your git
  history
  - Any bookmarks or links would need updating
  - The README.md might reference the old filename
                                                                           
⏺ User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿ Plan: Rename citation-finder.html to index.html

    1. Rename the file: git mv citation-finder.html index.html
    2. Update README.md: Check for any references to the old filename and 
    update them
    3. Commit the change: Create a clear commit message explaining the 
    rename
    4. Verify: Ensure the application still works correctly after the 
    rename

    This approach uses the web standard convention and makes the 
    application more accessible for web deployment.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Rename citation-finder.html to index.html using git mv             
     ☐ Commit the rename with clear message

     … +6 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I need to stage the modifications to index.html as well (the title and
  subtext changes):

⏺ Bash(git add index.html)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> ok go ahead

⏺ Bash(git add index.html)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "rename: Change citation-finder.html to index.html and

    l and update app naming

    … +13 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Rename citation-finder.html to index.html using git mv             
     ☒ Commit the rename with clear message
     ☒ Check README.md for references to old filename and update if needed
     ☒ Verify application still works after rename

⏺ Done! The file has been successfully renamed from citation-finder.html to
   index.html, and the app is now properly titled "Case Hallucination
  Assistant" with the updated subtext that acknowledges Free.law. The
  application will work the same way - just open index.html in a browser
  instead of the old filename.

> Let's look again at the case name extraction logic. Here is the context: 
  "wn internal waters. The principle was clearly established in Hudson 
  County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U.S. 349 (1908), which held that a 
  state’s police power does not extend to preventing the flow of river wate
   " Our algorithm reports Could not extract case name from your text - may
   be hallucinated  Yet to a human the case name is obvious: Hudson County 
  Water Co. v. McCarter. It's particularly troubling because the citation 
  is correct. Why is our regex logic failing. How could we develop better 
  regex logic?

⏺ Let me examine the current case name extraction logic to understand why
  it's failing on this obvious citation.

⏺ Search(pattern: "extractCaseName|case name|regex", path: "index.html",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 177 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me examine the specific extractCaseName function more closely:

⏺ Read(index.html)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I understand the problem! Looking at the user's example:

  Context: "wn internal waters. The principle was clearly established in
  Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U.S. 349 (1908), which held that
   a state's police power does not extend to preventing the flow of river
  wate"

  Problem Analysis:

  1. Current regex patterns require a comma after the case name - Most
  patterns look for caseName, citation format
  2. The example uses a different format - It has caseName, citation (year)
   format
  3. The key issue: The regex
  ([A-Z][a-zA-Z'\s]+\s+v\.?\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z'\s&]+?)\s*, should match "Hudson
   County Water Co. v. McCarter," but it's not working properly

  Specific Problems with Current Regex:

  1. Pattern #1: /\b([A-Z][a-zA-Z'\s]+\s+v\.?\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z'\s&]+?)\s*,/g
    - Should match but the +? (non-greedy) might be stopping too early
    - The \b word boundary might not work with "Co." because of the period
  2. Pattern #4:
  /\b([A-Z][a-zA-Z'\s]+\s+v\.?\s+[A-Z][a-zA-Z'\s&]+?)(?=\s*\d|\s*\()/g
    - This should work with the lookahead for digits, but again the word
  boundary issue

  Root Causes:
  1. Word boundary issues with abbreviations like "Co."
  2. Non-greedy matching stopping too early
  3. Character class limitations - doesn't account for periods in company
  names
  4. Lookahead patterns not comprehensive enough
